# DieselBundleViewer-Scripts

Forgot to do it but here is quick port of DieselToolBox scripts to DieselBundleViewer scripts.
Untested as much but they serve as an example of how they should work.

Create a folder named 'Scripts' in the executable directory for the bundle viewer and drop the scripts there (similarly to mods folder).
